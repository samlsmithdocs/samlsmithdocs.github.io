It is designed to allow you to forge/spoof a SAML response that would have been generated by an identity provider (IdP), sent to an application, referred to as a service provider (SP) in SAML.</p> <p>If you can forge a SAML response, you can effectively act as the identity provider, and gain access to the application as the target user.</p> <p>SAML response forging does have one big prerequisite - the ability to obtain the private key. In some instances, depending on how the SAML SP is configured, adding a new signing key-pair may work, however, you still need the ability to access the signing key.</p> <p>There are cases of finding private key material lying around as PKCS#12 archives, .pfx files - think file shares and the such, and a text file or CSV with the associated password(s). These would be the cases where, if any of those key-pairs are used for SAML response signing, that you could leverage them to forge a SAML response. In all the cloud Identity-as-a-service (IDaaS) platforms we have encountered, this is the case. That is, we have not seen an IDaaS that permitted exporting of the private signing key.</p> <p>Alternatively, specific to \"on-prem\" systems like Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), the private key material can be extracted from the system. AD FS has been a particular area of focus and research, particularly as it was a post-breach point of compromise during the Solorigate incident.</p> <p>Full details of other research and tools that we know of can be found in Tools and Research.</p> <p>The purpose of this guide is to help you understand SAML response forging, as well as how to perform it. Further, the guide contains some basic information about difference mechanisms of SAML and how they can, or cannot, defend against response forging.</p> <p>SAMLSmith must be compiled before use.</p> <p>If you believe something is missing that should be included in any part of this, have suggestions, edits, etc. please let us know by opening an issue on the docs.</p> <p>If you are concerned with something regarding the code itself, suggestions, bugs, etc. please let us know by opening an issue on the SAMLSmith repo.</p>"},{"location":"#docs-overview","title":"Docs Overview","text":""},{"location":"#using-samlsmith","title":"Using SAMLSmith","text":"<p>For help getting started with SAMLSmith.</p>"},{"location":"#saml-dictionary","title":"SAML Dictionary","text":"<p>A dictionary of common SAML terminology and it's meaning.</p>"},{"location":"#mechanics-of-saml","title":"Mechanics of SAML","text":"<p>Details on how SAML functions including flow diagrams.</p>"},{"location":"#identity-providers","title":"Identity Providers","text":"<p>Information on identity providers relating to SAML response forging.</p>"},{"location":"#defense-and-detection","title":"Defense and Detection","text":"<p>What can be done for mitigation and detection of SAML response forging.</p>"},{"location":"#other-tools-and-research","title":"Other Tools and Research","text":"<p>Information regarding other research and tools relating to SAML response forging.</p>"},{"location":"defense/","title":"Defense and Detection","text":"<p>Coming soon to a docs near you!</p>"},{"location":"dictionary/","title":"SAML Dictionary","text":"<p>In the world of identity a lot of terms can have multiple meanings, and when you mix vendors in a lot of vendor-specific terms can also make their way into our language.</p> <p>This section is to help you decode the different components of SAML.</p>"},{"location":"dictionary/#entity-id","title":"Entity ID","text":""},{"location":"dictionary/#nameid","title":"NameID","text":""},{"location":"dictionary/#recipient","title":"Recipient","text":""},{"location":"identityproviders/","title":"Identity Providers","text":"<p>Not every identity provider is susceptible to resposne forging.
